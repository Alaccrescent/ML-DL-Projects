### The Repository contains below projects:  

#### 1. Loan Defaulter Prediction

Description : Whenever an individual/corporation applies for a loan from a bank, their credit history undergoes a rigorous check to ensure that whether they are capable enough to pay off the loan. We have to build a model to automate this process of loan defaulter prediction to help decide whether to issue the loan to the individual or corporation.

Language : Python

Environment : Jupyter notebook

##### The Projects are divided into 6 sections :

1. <a href="https://github.com/Sneha1-1/Projects/blob/main/Loan_Defaulter_Prediction/Codes/LoanDefaulterPrediction_BasicScreening.ipynb">Basic screening</a>

2. <a href="https://github.com/Sneha1-1/ML-DL-Projects/blob/main/Loan_Defaulter_Prediction/Codes/LoanDefaulterPrediction_NATreatment.ipynb"> NA treatment </a>

3. Feature Engineering and EDA

5. Model Building pre steps

6. Model Building

7. Conclusions


### 2. Bank Credit Card Defaulter Prediction

Description : The banks with the intent of credit card were more focused on the number of customers using their credit service but the drawback of them not being able to pay back the credit in time was an issue that soon followed, a system was in need to effectively decide the credit limit to be allowed to a person based on his previous credit history

#### Outcome : 
1. We will apply different models on the dataset and compare them.
2. Learn how to build response encoded vector
3. Learn how to build One Hot Encoded vectors
4. Learn that oversampling helps improve performance in case of imbalanced dataset
