## 1. Loan Defaulter Prediction

Description : Whenever an individual/corporation applies for a loan from a bank, their credit history undergoes a rigorous check to ensure that whether they are capable enough to pay off the loan. We have to build a model to automate this process of loan defaulter prediction to help decide whether to issue the loan to the individual or corporation.

Language : Python

Environment : Jupyter notebook
