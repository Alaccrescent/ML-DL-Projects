Project Name : Loan Defaulter Prediction

Author : Sneha Bhalerao

Description : Whenever an individual/corporation applies for a loan from a bank, their credit history undergoes a rigorous check to ensure that whether they are capable enough to pay off the loan. We have to build a model to automate this process of loan defaulter prediction to help decide whether to issue the loan to the individual or corporation.

Language : Python

Codes : The Project is broken into smaller tasks and the codes for them are available in the codes folder.

The code is divided as below:

1. Basic Screening 
2. NA treatment
3. Exploratory data analysis
4. Feature engineering
5. Model Building pre-steps
6. Model Building
7. Conclusion
